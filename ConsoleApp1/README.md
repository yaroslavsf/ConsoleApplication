# Console Apllication

## Justification

- Input of numbers <br>
Operations with numbers are assumed to be with integers only.
- Task 1 <br>
![alt text](/task1.jpg)
The main functionallity is based on collections and operations upon them.
So method "Addieren" in first option of menu could have 2 meanings:
<br>a) 5 + 1 = 6 ❌
<br>b) calculate sum (<u>add</u> all numbers) ✅ <br>
I don't see the sense of implementing 1 operation from calculator in application that works with collections

- Task 2

## Localization
German

In case some unhadled exception while input is occured: 
![alt text](/unhandled_exception.png)
Error message would depend on OS language
